Power BI Project: Hospitality Revenue Dashboard for AtliQ Grands
Domain: Hospitality & Revenue Analytics
 
Tools Used: Power BI | DAX | Data Modeling | Visualization

As part of a business intelligence initiative for AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star hotels across India, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to help their revenue management team identify patterns and make data-driven decisions.

Business Challenge:
AtliQ Grands was experiencing revenue and market share decline due to poor strategic visibility. They needed business insights but lacked an internal analytics team.

ðŸš€ My Contribution:
Designed a clean, insight-rich dashboard based on stakeholder mock-up.
Built key revenue metrics like RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, Cancellation %, Revenue by Property.
Implemented dynamic filtering using dropdown slicers for city, property, booking status, month, and week.
Added key visuals for Revenue Trends, Booking vs Cancellation, and Day-type Comparisons.
Included a matrix for property-level KPIs, enhancing granularity and performance tracking.
ðŸ“ˆ Value Delivered:
1. Provided leadership a centralized view of revenue performance.
2. Enabled better decision-making using real-time, filterable insights.
3. Delivered strategic insights on booking trends and property performance.
4. Proposed additional insights not in the original brief, including weekday vs weekend trends, and ratings analysis by city.
